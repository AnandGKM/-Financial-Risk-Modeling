# -Financial-Risk-Modeling

This project identifies credit default risk using Python, SQL, logistic regression, and decision trees. It involved mining borrower behavior and economic indicators to uncover risk drivers. Interactive Tableau dashboards enabled real-time monitoring and data-driven credit policy decisions.



This project, "Financial Risk Modeling & Visualization," conducted from October to December 2024, aimed to analyze borrower profiles and predict loan default likelihood using machine learning and statistical methods to support credit policy and proactive risk detection. Utilizing a dataset of 45,000 records from "Anand_Gopalakrishnamurthy_loan_data.xlsx," the analysis focused on demographics, credit factors, and loan status.

The methodology involved Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib), SQL, and Tableau, applying data cleaning, preprocessing, logistic regression, and decision tree modeling, with evaluation via ROC-AUC and accuracy metrics. Modeling results showed Logistic Regression with an 89.0% accuracy and 0.943 ROC-AUC, while Decision Tree achieved 88.4% accuracy and 0.948 ROC-AUC. Key findings indicated Credit Score and Loan Interest Rate as top predictors.

Visual insights from Tableau highlighted approval rates by demographics, loan amount versus income trends, default rates by credit history, and credit score distributions. The project's business impact included enabling targeted credit decisions through risk segmentation, identifying demographic approval biases, and equipping stakeholders with actionable insights via Tableau dashboards. The conclusion emphasized that combining machine learning and visualization exposed risk profiles missed by traditional rules, advocating for a data-driven strategy to refine credit approval and mitigate risk. Deliverables included a Tableau Dashboard, the data file, model output, Python notebook, and presentation slides.
